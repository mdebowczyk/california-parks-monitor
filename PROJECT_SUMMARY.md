## How It Works

### Data Source
Uses **Recreation.gov API** - the official reservation system for U.S. national parks.

### Monitoring Process
1. Queries Recreation.gov for each configured park
2. Checks campground availability for June 2026
3. Checks permit/ticket availability (if enabled)
4. Compares results with previous checks
5. Sends notifications when new availability is found

### Notification Flow
1. Availability detected
2. Formats notification message with details
3. Sends via configured channels (email, webhook, SMS)
4. Tracks notification to avoid duplicates
5. Provides direct booking links

### Scheduling
- Runs continuously in a loop
- Configurable check interval (default: 60 minutes)
- Respectful API usage with delays
- Automatic retry on failures

## Setup Time

- **Minimum Setup:** 5 minutes (email only)
- **Full Setup:** 15-30 minutes (all features)
- **Deployment:** 30-60 minutes (cloud/Docker)

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Internet connection
- 50 MB disk space
- Minimal CPU/RAM (runs efficiently)

### Account Requirements
- Email account (Gmail recommended)
- Optional: Twilio account for SMS
- Optional: Slack/Discord for webhooks

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Personal Use
- Monitor favorite parks
- Get notified when reservations open
- Book quickly before sites fill up

### Scenario 2: Group Planning
- Monitor multiple parks
- Share notifications with group
- Coordinate booking strategy

### Scenario 3: Flexible Travel
- Monitor all parks
- Take first available
- Maximize chances of getting a spot

## Timeline

### Current Status (September 2025)
- Reservations for June 2026 not yet open
- Monitor will show "No availability found"
- This is expected and normal

### December 2025
- Reservations for June 2026 will open
- Monitor will detect availability
- Notifications will be sent
- **Action required:** Book quickly!

### June 2026
- Enjoy your camping trip! üèïÔ∏è
