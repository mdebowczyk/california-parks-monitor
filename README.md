## Installation

### 1. Clone or Download

Download all the files to a directory on your computer.

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want SMS notifications, also install Twilio:
```bash
pip install twilio
```

### 3. Configure the Agent

Edit `config.yaml` to customize your monitoring preferences:

#### Email Notifications Setup

To enable email notifications, you'll need to configure SMTP settings. For Gmail:

1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
2. Generate an app-specific password:
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" and your device
   - Copy the generated password
3. Update `config.yaml`:

```yaml
notifications:
  email:
    enabled: true
    smtp_server: "smtp.gmail.com"
    smtp_port: 587
    sender_email: "your-email@gmail.com"
    sender_password: "your-app-password"  # Use the app password here
    recipient_emails:
      - "your-email@gmail.com"
```

#### Webhook Notifications Setup (Optional)

For Slack:
1. Create a Slack webhook: https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks
2. Update `config.yaml`:

```yaml
notifications:
  webhook:
    enabled: true
    url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
```

For Discord:
1. Create a Discord webhook in your server settings
2. Update `config.yaml` with the webhook URL

#### SMS Notifications Setup (Optional)

1. Sign up for Twilio: https://www.twilio.com/
2. Get your Account SID, Auth Token, and phone number
3. Update `config.yaml`:

```yaml
notifications:
  sms:
    enabled: true
    twilio_account_sid: "your-account-sid"
    twilio_auth_token: "your-auth-token"
    twilio_phone_number: "+1234567890"
    recipient_phone_numbers:
      - "+1234567890"
```

#### Customize Parks and Dates

Edit the parks list and target dates in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
parks:
  - name: "Yosemite National Park"
    park_id: "2991"
    check_camping: true
    check_permits: true

target_dates:
  start_date: "2026-06-01"
  end_date: "2026-06-30"
```

#### Adjust Check Interval

```yaml
monitoring:
  check_interval_minutes: 60  # Check every hour
```

## Usage

### Run Continuously (Recommended)

This will check for availability at regular intervals:

```bash
python park_monitor.py
```

The agent will:
- Check all configured parks immediately
- Continue checking at the interval specified in config.yaml
- Send notifications when availability is found
- Run until you stop it (Ctrl+C)

### Run Once

To perform a single check and exit:

```bash
python park_monitor.py --once
```

### Use Custom Config File

```bash
python park_monitor.py --config my_custom_config.yaml
```

## How It Works

1. **Data Source:** The agent uses Recreation.gov's API, which is the official reservation system for most national parks.

2. **Monitoring Process:**
   - Queries Recreation.gov for each configured park
   - Checks campground availability for June 2026
   - Checks permit/ticket availability (if enabled)
   - Compares results with previous checks

3. **Notifications:**
   - When new availability is detected, sends notifications via configured channels
   - Tracks what has been notified to avoid spam
   - Provides direct booking links in notifications

4. **Respectful API Usage:**
   - Includes delays between requests
   - Uses appropriate user agent headers
   - Implements retry logic with backoff

## Understanding Recreation.gov Reservations

### Booking Windows

Recreation.gov typically opens reservations:
- **Camping:** 6 months in advance (rolling window)
- **Permits:** Varies by park and permit type

For June 2026 reservations:
- Camping sites will likely open in December 2025
- Some permits may open earlier (lottery systems)

### Peak Season Considerations

June is peak season for California national parks:
- High demand, especially for Yosemite and Sequoia
- Sites fill up within minutes of release
- Having an automated monitor gives you an advantage

## Troubleshooting

### No Availability Found

- **Too Early:** Reservations for June 2026 may not be open yet
- **Already Booked:** Popular sites book quickly
- **Check Dates:** Verify target dates in config.yaml

### Email Not Sending

- Verify SMTP settings
- Check that you're using an app-specific password (not your regular password)
- Check spam folder
- Review logs for error messages

### API Errors

- Recreation.gov may have rate limits
- Increase check_interval_minutes if you see frequent errors
- Check your internet connection

### Logs

Check `availability_monitor.log` for detailed information:
```bash
tail -f availability_monitor.log
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Monitor Specific Campgrounds

You can modify the code to target specific campgrounds by their IDs. Check Recreation.gov URLs for campground IDs.

### Custom Notification Templates

Edit the `format_notification_message` method in `park_monitor.py` to customize email templates.

### Add More Parks

Add any park that uses Recreation.gov to the config:

```yaml
parks:
  - name: "Your Park Name"
    park_id: "PARK_ID"  # Find this on Recreation.gov
    check_camping: true
    check_permits: false
```

## Running as a Background Service

### Linux/Mac (using systemd)

Create a service file `/etc/systemd/system/park-monitor.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=California Parks Availability Monitor
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your-username
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/park-monitor
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/park-monitor/park_monitor.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable park-monitor
sudo systemctl start park-monitor
```

### Windows (using Task Scheduler)

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Set trigger (e.g., "At startup")
4. Action: Start a program
5. Program: `python`
6. Arguments: `C:\path\to\park_monitor.py`

### Using Docker

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "park_monitor.py"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t park-monitor .
docker run -d --name park-monitor park-monitor
```

## Important Notes

### Recreation.gov Terms of Service

- This tool is for personal use only
- Do not abuse the API with excessive requests
- Respect rate limits and use reasonable check intervals
- The default 60-minute interval is recommended

### Booking Tips

When you receive a notification:
1. **Act quickly** - popular sites book within minutes
2. **Have an account ready** - Create a Recreation.gov account in advance
3. **Save payment info** - Speed up the checkout process
4. **Be flexible** - Consider alternative dates or campgrounds

### Limitations

- Cannot guarantee you'll get a reservation (high competition)
- Recreation.gov may change their API without notice
- Some parks have lottery systems instead of first-come-first-served
- Permit systems vary by park and may require manual checking
